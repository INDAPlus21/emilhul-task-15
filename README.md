In almost-union-find is a proposed solution to the kattis problem [Almost Union-Find](https://open.kattis.com/problems/almostunionfind). NOTE: If you have an issue with this Kattis problem it might be due to the input file. Seems like it can put some empty lines in the begining of the input that can mess you up. Atleast I only changed how I did input and it suddenly began working.

In the other folder, binary-tree, is an implementation of an AVL tree complete with test.

## How to run

* Clone repo
* Navigate into either `almost-union-find` or `binary-tree` depending on which one you want to run.
* For `almost-union-find` run `cargo run` in repo directory
* For `binary-tree` run `cargo test` in repo directory to run tests

# emilhul-task-15 (W.I.P.)

A proposed solution to the kattis problem [Almost Union-Find](https://open.kattis.com/problems/almostunionfind). However this solution does not work on kattis. Still working on trying to figure that out.

This is also the reason why the supposed binary tree isn't a binary tree at all but a hello world program. Hoping to fix that until last time.

## How to run

* Clone repo
* Navigate into either `almost-union-find` or `binary-tree` depending on which one you want to run.
* Run `cargo run` in repo directory
